Almost all modern technological equipment, makes use of an in-built computer system. This system also known as an Embedded system, has a sole function of controlling the equipment in real time and ensuring that the product always works safely. Although such systems are used every day, most people do not know how to create it. This report details the processes that went into the development of a fuel dispenser controlled by an embedded system.  
The first stage in the development process was the design, which highlights the system specifications as well as the platform upon which this system was built. Then the implementation, detailing how the software that controls the functions of the system was written and how the hardware components of the dispenser interfaces with the software. The testing and evaluation stage details how the system was debugged during the program development and what measures were taken to solve arising issues. Some innovations were also implemented during the development.
The completion of this fuel dispenserâ€™s development delivers a good level of programming and embedded systems development skills to the developer.
